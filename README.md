# Isometric2DGame
This is my project for the Runic Dice Entertainment programming trial. Itâ€™s made in Unity 2D (URP, version 6000.1.4f1) and includes several tasks that focus on different parts of gameplay programming and workflow.

The project covers: Setting up and managing a Unity project with GitHub Creating isometric player movement using the new Input System Building a simple enemy AI with state-based behavior Adding a personal feature (combat, inventory, or dialogue system)

The goal of this project is to show my understanding of gameplay systems, clean structure, and problem-solving while working independently.
