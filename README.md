# Isometric2DGame
This is my project for the Runic Dice Entertainment programming trial. Itâ€™s made in Unity 2D (URP, version 6000.1.4f1) and includes several tasks that focus on different parts of gameplay programming and workflow.

The project covers: Setting up and managing a Unity project with GitHub Creating isometric player movement using the new Input System Building a simple enemy AI with state-based behavior Adding a personal feature (combat, inventory, or dialogue system)

The goal of this project is to show my understanding of gameplay systems, clean structure, and problem-solving while working independently.



Play by starting from Menu scene. Gameplay wise you attack with the mouse click. The attack is in the direction that your player is facing and not where you click. E to interact with Npc.
